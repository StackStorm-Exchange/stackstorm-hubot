# WARNING!

Most people do not need this pack. If you want to use ChatOps with StackStorm, use the st2chatops package, which is installed by default with StackStorm.
The chatops pack (st2chatops package) includes Hubot, already wired up to StackStorm.
See docs.stackstorm.com/chatops/index.html for more about how to configure ChatOps.

Only install this pack if you are _really_ sure that you need it. See the [Actions section](#actions) to see if this pack is useful for you.

# Hubot Integration Pack
